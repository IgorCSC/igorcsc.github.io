I'm Igor, an **artificial intelligence researcher & practitioner**. I'm a full-time Ph.D. candidate at the Institute of Mathematics and Statistics of the University of São Paulo (IME - USP), where I work with non-monotonic and defeasible logics. I also spent some as a visiting researcher in the Chair of Automata Theory of the Technische Universität Dresden, in Germany.

I'm a firm believer in interdisciplinarity and keep an eye on a wide array of subjects. Before getting into computer science, I completed a master's in mathematical logic at the University of Campinas (UNICAMP). In days of yore, I graduated in philosophy, with an emphasis in logic, philosophy of language.
Besides **knowledge representation & reasoning**, I'm also interested in other AI areas, such as **machine learning** and **natural language processing**.
